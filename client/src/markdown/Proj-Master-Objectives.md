## Main Stages

Section A - Main Layout (Outline Format)
Section B - Design Wireframe
  B1.Notes
  > The Components are done first, We then make structures from the componenets, then we make pages from the structures. This way we can reuse the code and just go in and change the jss and/or css. 

  - B1.1.Component Library
    - -> 1-Components 
    - -> 2-Structures
    - -> 3-Pages
   - B1.2.Prototyping
     - -> 1-Using Figma
        1. Have main menu for hex# and other Notes
        2. From the main menu, go up and create another box. This box will hold the structure in `Section A` so it we can visit there when we are making the prototypes. 
        3. Testing 1234


Section C - Developing the site
Section D - Adding Features
Section E - Creating Build
